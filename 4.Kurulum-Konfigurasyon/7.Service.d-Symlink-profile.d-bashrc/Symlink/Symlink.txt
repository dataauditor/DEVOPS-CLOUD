1.Hands-on:
- aws-cli'i symlink ile baglama:
curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"
unzip awscliv2.zip
sudo ./aws/install

./aws/install -i /usr/local/aws-cli -b /usr/local/bin
  * --install-dir or -i – This option specifies the directory to copy all of the files to.
  * The default value is /usr/local/aws-cli.
  * --bin-dir or -b – This option specifies that the main aws program in the install directory is symbolically linked to the file aws in the specified path. You must have write permissions to the specified directory. Creating a symlink to a directory that is already in your path eliminates the need to add the install directory to the user's $PATH variable.
  * The default value is /usr/local/bin.

sudo ./aws/install --bin-dir /usr/local/bin --install-dir /usr/local/aws-cli --update
  * To update your current installation of the AWS CLI, add your existing symlink and installer information to construct the install command with the --update parameter.
  * 
which aws
  * "/usr/local/bin/aws" ciktisini gosterir.
  * Use the which command to find your symlink. This gives you the path to use with the --bin-dir parameter.
ls -l /usr/local/bin/aws
  * Use the ls command to find the directory that your symlink points to. This gives you the path to use with the --install-dir parameter.
aws --version
