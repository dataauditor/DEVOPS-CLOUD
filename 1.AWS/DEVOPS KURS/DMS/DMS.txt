AWS Database Migration Service:

AWS Database Migration Service helps you migrate databases to AWS quickly and securely.
Use along with the Schema Conversion Tool (SCT) to migrate databases to AWS RDS or EC2-based databases.
The source database remains fully operational during the migration, minimizing downtime to applications that rely on the database.
The AWS Database Migration Service can migrate your data to and from the most widely used commercial and open-source databases.
Schema Conversion Tool can copy database schemas for homogenous migrations (same database) and convert schemas for heterogeneous migrations (different databases).
DMS is used for smaller, simpler conversions and also supports MongoDB and DynamoDB.
SCT is used for larger, more complex datasets like data warehouses.
DMS has replication functions for on-premise to AWS or to Snowball or S3.
The RDS service includes the following:
  - Security and patching of the DB instances.
  - Automated backup for the DB instances.
  - Software updates for the DB engine.
  - Easy scaling for storage and compute.
  - Multi-AZ option with synchronous replication.
  - Automatic failover for Multi-AZ option.
  - Read replicas option for read-heavy workloads.
