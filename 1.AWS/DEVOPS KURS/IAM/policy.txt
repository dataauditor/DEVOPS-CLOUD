  - Every role has two policies: A trust policy and a permission policy.
    - The trust policy defines who can assume the role. It is a JSON policy document in which you define the principals that you trust to assume the role.
    - The permission policy is just an IAM policy that gives that role some permissions on some things. It can be thought of as the same as an IAM policy on a group. A permissions document in JSON format in which you define what actions and resources the role can use. The document is written according to the rules of the IAM policy language.
