Elasticache:

Elasticache is a managed in-memory caching service.
The in-memory caching provided by ElastiCache can be used to significantly improve latency and throughput for many read-heavy application workloads or compute-intensive workloads
Elasticache can launch either Memcache or Redis:
  - Memcache is a simple key/value store preferred for caching HTML fragments and is arguably faster than Redis. Memcache is not persistent and cannot be used as a data store but employed cache the contents of a DB.
  - Redis has richer data types and operations. Great for the leaderboard, geospatial data or keeping track of unread notifications. Data is persistent with Redis. Scales by adding shards, not nodes.
Most frequently identical queries are stored in the cache
Resources only within the same VPC may connect to Elasticache to ensure low latencies.
Use cases:
Web session store: In case with load-balanced web servers, store web session information in Redis so if a server is lost, the session info is not lost and another web server can pick it up
Database caching: Use Memcached in front of AWS RDS to cache popular queries to offload work from RDS and return results faster to the user
Leaderboards: Use Redis to provide a live leaderboard for millions of users of your mobile app
Streaming data dashboards: Provide a landing spot for streaming sensor data on the factory floor, providing live real-time dashboards displays
