> Source VM'lere agent yuklenir. 
  > Agent app'leri, dicc'leri ve db'leri AWS'de staging area subnet'e replica eder. Daha sonra target resourcelari kurar.
  > Ilk replicadan sonra agent source'taki degisimleri target'lara migrate eder.
  > Daha sonra istenilen sekilde restructure, rewrite, and re-architect your applications yapilabilir.
- CloudEndure Migration is an agent-based tool that rehosts your applications on AWS. 
- CloudEndure Migration simplifies, expedites, and automates large-scale migrations to AWS. 
- Continuous data replication takes place in the background, without application disruption or performance impact, which ensures that data is synchronized in real time and minimizes cutover windows.
- It supports self-service, highly automated, lift-and-shift migrations with minimal business disruption. 
- You install the CloudEndure Agent on your source machines. 
- The Agent replicates your applications and data in a staging area on AWS. 
- After the initial replication, the CloudEndure Agent tracks and migrates changes from your source environment to the target staging area by using asynchronous, block-level data replication, without causing downtime or affecting performance.
- You can use CloudEndureâ€™s self-service, web-based console to configure your target environment, to check for compatibility issues, and to validate that your applications are fully operational on AWS before you cut over. 
- After you rehost your workloads on AWS, you can restructure, rewrite, and re-architect your applications and take advantage of AWS services.
- CloudEndure Migration supports both Microsoft Windows and Linux-based workloads
- After migration, even the most complex applications and databases run natively on AWS, without compatibility issues and with minimal IT skills necessary.

        - Individual VM bazinda replicationun son durumunu gosterir.
        - Pause kullanilirsa eski snapshotlar dahil siler. Stop kullanirsak silmez.
        - Otomatik replikasyona baslamayan makineler secilerek "Start Data Replication" tiklanir.
