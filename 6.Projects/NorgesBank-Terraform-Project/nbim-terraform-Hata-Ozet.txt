b.Establish Environment with Terraform and Problems:
- When i used "terraform apply", environment is established but there was a problem with "agent codebuild" in codepipeline.
- Afterwards i solved the problem with the related Dockerfile. There was a code which was absent in the Dockerfile.
- After i solved the problem i restart the codepipeline again, but this time the deployment process to ecs which is name "Controller Deploy" worked endless. After approximately one hour it stopped and gave a message which is "time is expired".
- When i try to debugging i noticed that there is no data for debugging in codepipeline, so i tried to check ECS Fargate, but i couldn't find a reasonable explanation about the error in ECS.
- I am not sure but i will connect to ecs fargates from bash and check if the image is downloaded or installed or maybe there is another problem. If the image is not downloaded i can download and install with shell.
